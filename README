
About
-----

This project provides the implementation of a number of algorithms for computing
Suffix Arrays over sequences of symbols of arbitrary size (not only strings).

Rationale
---------

Suffix arrays are an extremely powerful data structure, useful in many areas of
computer science. The theoretical bounds for computing suffix arrays is, just as with
suffix trees, O(n). Their practical implementation is in many cases much faster because
of data access locality.

This project was started because not many suffix arrays algorithms have been ported
from the C (pointers, pointers) world and out of shear curiosity to see which algorithm
will perform best.
